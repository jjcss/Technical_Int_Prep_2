I just wanted to give a big thank you to everyone who joined us. Hopefully you learned something and will continue coming to the rest of our meetings. Below are the steps in order to access the problems that we worked on today, with a separate link with the solutions to these problems. This was an introductory level to technical interviews and we only solved probelms that involved manipulating strings and getting arrays indexes. Please try to solve these problems on your own first, and then if you get stuck or want to compare your answers take a look at the solutions file.

Steps to Accessing Questions Repl.it File

Step 2: If you have a Replit account then fork this repl file
Step 3: If you don't have an accoung, make one and then fork the repl file.
Step 4: After forking the repl file, go to the main.py file. Make sure that based on the problems you are solving, the only lines uncommented are those questions. Below, since I am starting on problem 0, I only have those two lines ucommented.

Step 5: For each problem, you'll see that they all have various test cases that you have to account for. If you pass all tests, and you run your code, you'll should get a blank output. This means that all your tests cases have passed. If you want to get an output that your test cases passed, then add this to all of your problems test function. All I did was add the else statement with the print statement. Example below...
