# CSS Technical Interview Prep #1

<b>Date</b>: October 16th, 2021 <br>
<b>Time</b>: 12:00PM - 1:00PM <br>
<b>Lead</b>: Leandro Gamarra <br>

I just wanted to give a big thank you to everyone who joined us. Hopefully you learned something and will continue coming to the rest of our meetings. Below are the steps in order to access the problems that we worked on today, with a separate link with the solutions to these problems. This was an introductory level to technical interviews and we only solved probelms that involved manipulating strings and getting arrays indexes. Please try to solve these problems on your own first, and then if you get stuck or want to compare your answers take a look at the solutions file.

This means that all your tests cases have passed. If you want to get an output that your test cases passed, then add this to all of your problems test function. All I did was add the else statement with the print statement. Example below... <br>
