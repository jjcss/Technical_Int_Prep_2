<b>Step 3</b>: If you don't have an account, make one and then fork the repl file. <br>
<b>Step 4</b>: After forking the repl file, go to the main.py file. Make sure that based on the problems you are solving, the only lines uncommented are those questions. Below, since I am starting on problem 1, I only have those two lines ucommented. <br>

<b>Step 5</b>: For each problem, you'll see that they all have various test cases that you have to account for. If you pass all tests, and you run your code, you'll should get a blank output. This means that all your tests cases have passed. That's all. Happy coding!
